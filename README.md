# My First Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes seems to be everywhere today, but many organizations have yet to take
the plunge. The Kubernetes ecosystem has so many options that it feels scary to
start, especially when we are still working with traditional servers and
applications. But that ecosystem also contains tools to provide guardrails to
keep us safe.

In this workshop, we'll work with a Kubernetes cluster to give us valuable
insights into what the cluster is doing. We will use Kubernetes commands to
deploy, upgrade, scale, and manage your application. We'll use tools to keep
your cluster and applications secure and implement recommended practices. By the
end of the workshop, we'll know the basics of Kubernetes and see how our
traditional projects could work differently as containerized Kubernetes
workloads.

This is a hands-on tutorial. You will need your laptop. Understanding container
basics, at least at a "Hello World" level, would help, but you don't need to be
an expert. Kubernetes uses containers, but a passing familiarity with them will
be enough.

## Further learning

To learn cluster administration and set up, do [Kubernetes the Hard
Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). Then never do
it without a tool again.
